    1. Accruracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance Management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the intevitable and costly errors with manul data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate perfomance and payroll data.
    <br>
    2. Econonics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control cost? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abusse, and overpaayment .

    <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can  be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards schedules, authorize leave and overtime , and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accurary helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profites.
